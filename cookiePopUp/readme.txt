This animation was created while following a tutorial ('JavaScript Animations for Beginners') 
hosted on a YouTube by the created 'developedbyed"

The link to the video is (and hopefully still is)  https://youtu.be/r1iul4uRFuE

The Cookie SVG was imported to Adobe XD and I used the code that the application generated 
in the index.html file included for this animation. I've included the file here for 
convenience.
